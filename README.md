To install, download the folder, unzip, and open RStudio. From RStudio click Preferences, Appearance, Add, and then navigate to the rstheme for the theme that you'd like to install. Click apply.

If you're comfortable installing from the console and have [Devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) installed then you can copy and run the following in your console:
